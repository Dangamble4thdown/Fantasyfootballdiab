    <h3>üèà AI's Picks: Who Will Win?</h3>
    <p>After analyzing the rosters, matchups, and player performances, **Louis' team** is predicted to win this fantasy showdown in half-PPR scoring. Louis' team features elite talent in Saquon Barkley, who thrives in both the rushing and passing game. Barkley‚Äôs ability to accumulate yards and receptions provides a stable floor with significant upside. Additionally, Jayden Daniels‚Äô dual-threat nature as a rushing quarterback adds consistent points that can swing the matchup in Louis‚Äô favor.</p>

    <p>Louis' wide receiver corps, led by Nico Collins and Jauan Jennings, is well-rounded and capable of producing double-digit points, even in half-PPR formats. Aaron Jones, though slightly volatile, remains a dependable RB2 option with goal-line upside. Pat Freiermuth offers a red-zone target at tight end, boosting his potential to score touchdowns. This combination of star power and depth allows Louis' team to edge out Liam‚Äôs lineup, which relies heavily on Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase and Tua Tagovailoa to carry the scoring load.</p>

    <p>While Liam‚Äôs roster possesses explosive players, the variance at RB2 and potential injury risks to Mark Andrews create uncertainty. In a close contest, Louis' balanced attack and reliable scoring options across multiple positions make him the favorite to win.</p>

    <p>**Final Score Prediction (Half-PPR):**  
    - **Louis' Team:** 138.9  
    - **Liam's Team:** 131.4</p>

    <p>Louis' edge in consistent performers like Barkley and Daniels should help him secure the victory by a narrow margin.</p>

    <!-- Week 17 Waiver Wire Article -->
    <h3>üî• Week 17 Waiver Wire Pickups</h3>
    <p>Looking to strengthen your roster for the playoffs? Here are the top 10 waiver wire targets based on recent performances and projected opportunities. Suggested FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget) amounts are included to help guide your bids.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>A. Rodgers (NYJ - QB)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 20-25%</em>  
            <p>Aaron Rodgers is nearing a return and could provide immediate value for fantasy managers looking for a QB. His experience and poise make him a top-tier option for the stretch run. The Jets will likely unleash Rodgers as they push for the playoffs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>C. Rush (DAL - QB)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 10-15%</em>  
            <p>Rush has proven capable when filling in for Dak Prescott. As the Cowboys gear up for playoff positioning, Rush could see more action. He‚Äôs a solid insurance policy at QB.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>D. Thompson-Robinson (CLE - QB)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 10%</em>  
            <p>DTR offers dual-threat potential and has flashed in His last game. His rushing ability boosts his fantasy floor, making him valuable in deeper leagues or superflex formats.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>W. Robinson (NYG - WR)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 12-18%</em>  
            <p>Robinson is becoming a go-to target for the Giants. His target share makes him valuable in PPR leagues, and his role should grow as the Giants lean on their young core. Owners should be careful though, as he is not quite a YAC player.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>B. Cooks (DAL - WR)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 10-15%</em>  
            <p>Cooks has big-play potential and is a vital part of the Cowboys‚Äô passing attack. Especially with Ceedee Lamb's banged up shoulder, Cooks should be targeted more. His ability to produce yards after the catch gives him flex appeal in favorable matchups.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>D. Moore (CAR - WR)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 8-10%</em>  
            <p>Moore‚Äôs involvement is increasing, and the Panthers' passing game is shifting towards evaluation mode. Moore could benefit from additional targets, making him a sleeper add.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>T. Patrick (DET - WR)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 8%</em>  
            <p>Patrick is working his way as a red-zone threat for the Lions and Patrick could emerge as a late-season difference-maker.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>G. Calcaterra (PHI - TE)</strong>  
            <br> <em>FAAB: 5-8%</em>  
            <p>With Goedert banged up, Calcaterra will and has seen more opportunities. The Eagles offense features tight ends prominently, giving Calcaterra upside as a plug-and-play TE for fantasy managers. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>üèÜ <em>Prioritize quarterbacks if you need stability or upside at the position. For flex spots, focus on receivers like Wan‚ÄôDale Robinson and Brandin Cooks for immediate impact.</em></p>
