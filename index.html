        <p><strong>Grade: Louisdiab (C), Windsor Express (A+)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Grade: PierreDiab (A), Thesungawd (C-)</strong></p>
        <p>Analysis: PierreDiab capitalized on strong outings by Aaron Jones and Jefferson. Thesungawd fell short with weak performances by key players.</p>
        <p><strong>Best Advice:</strong> PierreDiab should focus on bolstering flex positions. Thesungawd must explore trades for consistent scorers.</p>

        <p><strong>Matchup 6:</strong> Hurts So Good vs. Injured Reserve</p>
        <p><strong>Grade: Hurts So Good (B-), Injured Reserve (A+)</strong></p>

            <h4>Week 14 Power Rankings</h4>
            <ol>
                 <li><strong>1. Team Louisdiab (11-3):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Despite a tough loss in Week 14, Louisdiab remains the team to beat. With Justin Herbert leading the starting lineup and incredible depth at quarterback with Bo Nix and Jayden Daniels, this team has the firepower to compete at the highest level.</p>
                <p><strong>Jayden Daniels' Fantasy Stats:</strong> Daniels has been a fantasy monster this season, contributing as both a passer and a rusher. He consistently racks up points with his dual-threat ability, putting up over 30 fantasy points in multiple games. His rushing touchdowns and explosive big-play ability make him a valuable weapon as Louisdiab heads into the playoffs.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Herbert needs to rebound from his Week 14 performance, and the team must find more consistency in the flex positions.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2. Injured Reserve (10-4):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Injured Reserve has been a consistent powerhouse with solid QB play and depth in skill positions. Josh Allen continues to lead the way with explosive fantasy performances.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Depth at WR could be an issue if injuries strike.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. Windsor Express (7-7):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Windsor Express delivered a statement win in Week 14. Their balanced roster and a massive week from Allen are propelling them forward.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Running back consistency remains a concern.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>4. Liam Mastronardi (9-5):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> A strong Week 14 outing showcased the depth and firepower of Liamâ€™s roster. Tua Tagovailoa led the charge, supported by a solid WR core.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Tight end production could use improvement.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>5. PierreDiab (7-7):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> PierreDiab bounced back with a strong performance, leaning heavily on stars like Aaron Jones and Justin Jefferson.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Needs to address RB2 consistency.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>6. Hurts So Good (8-6):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This teamâ€™s strength lies in its QB and RB positions, but injuries have hampered their full potential.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> WR production has been below par recently.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>7. MCDC (9-5):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Strong defensive play and QB performance keep this team competitive. Cousins continues to deliver.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Needs to address bench depth heading into playoffs.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>8. Android Nightmares (6-8):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Joe Burrow and a capable WR core are the team's bright spots. They remain competitive despite a sub-.500 record.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> RB production has been hit or miss.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>9. Thesungawd (6-8):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> A tough loss in Week 14 highlighted the teamâ€™s reliance on a few key players. RB depth has been inconsistent.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Needs a stronger WR3 or flex option to stay competitive.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>10. The Lions Champ (3-11):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Despite the record, the team has potential with some bright spots in the WR core. Struggles in QB and RB production remain.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Needs a full roster overhaul in the offseason.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>11. JustwinBaby! (3-11):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This team has struggled across the board but has shown glimpses of potential in individual players.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Needs consistent scoring from starters and depth.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>12. #Tanking (5-9):</strong>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The name reflects the reality. A lack of effort in waiver pickups and poor performance has led to a disappointing season.</p>
                <p><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Focus on draft strategy and trades for next season.</p>

                <li><strong>Isaiah Davis (RB, NYJ):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 14 carries, 84 yards, 1 TD (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Davis has stepped into a larger role for the Jets, benefiting from an injury to Breece Hall. He offers a strong rushing presence with occasional targets, making him a viable RB2/flex option. His matchup this week is favorable, boosting his chances for another productive outing.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Michael Wilson (WR, ARI):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 5 receptions, 78 yards, 1 TD (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Wilson is developing as a reliable option for Arizona, particularly in contested catch situations. Heâ€™s a red-zone threat and offers steady WR3 value in half-PPR leagues. With a soft matchup against a struggling secondary, Wilson is a sneaky good play in Week 14.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Jaylen Wright (RB, MIA):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 10 carries, 55 yards; 2 receptions, 18 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Wright is finding his groove in Miamiâ€™s high-powered offense. While Mostert still dominates touches, Wright is carving out a role as a versatile change-of-pace back. Heâ€™s worth a look for teams in need of RB depth heading into playoffs.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Roschon Johnson (RB, CHI):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 8 carries, 42 yards; 3 receptions, 21 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Johnson continues to see steady involvement in Chicagoâ€™s backfield, particularly in passing downs. His dual-threat ability makes him a viable flex option in deeper leagues. Heâ€™s a smart pickup for fantasy managers needing running back depth.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Justice Hill (RB, BAL):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 9 carries, 48 yards, 1 TD (Week 13).</p>
                <p>With Derrick Henry now leading Baltimoreâ€™s backfield, Hill has become a valuable change-of-pace option. Heâ€™s still seeing red-zone touches and offers standalone value in deeper formats. His Week 14 matchup makes him a great speculative add.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Noah Brown (WR, WSH):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 3 receptions, 27 yards, 0 TD (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Brown remains a boom-or-bust flex option, but his ability to stretch the field is undeniable. Heâ€™s worth adding if you need a big-play threat, especially with Washingtonâ€™s softer upcoming schedule.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pat Freiermuth (TE, PIT):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 6 receptions, 58 yards, 1 TD (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Freiermuth has reclaimed his role as a red-zone weapon in Pittsburgh. Heâ€™s a solid TE1 option for managers streaming the position or needing a reliable weekly starter.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Devin Singletary (RB, HOU):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 12 carries, 67 yards; 2 receptions, 10 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Singletary has emerged as a steady contributor in Houstonâ€™s offense. Heâ€™s a great RB2 option for managers looking to stabilize their lineup heading into playoffs.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alec Pierce (WR, IND):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 5 receptions, 72 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Pierceâ€™s involvement in the Coltsâ€™ offense has increased, and heâ€™s benefiting from solid quarterback play. His upcoming matchup makes him a reliable flex option for Week 14.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Khalil Herbert (RB, CHI):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 10 carries, 45 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Herbert is splitting carries but still offers enough volume to be fantasy-relevant. Heâ€™s a solid depth option with potential upside depending on game flow.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Josh Downs (WR, IND):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 7 receptions, 81 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Downs continues to be a reliable target for Indianapolis. His consistent involvement makes him a valuable WR3/flex option in half-PPR leagues.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sean Tucker (RB, TB):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 11 carries, 60 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Tucker is seeing an increased role as Tampa Bayâ€™s coaching staff looks for fresh offensive options. Heâ€™s a deep-league stash with upside in favorable matchups.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Juwan Johnson (TE, NO):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 5 receptions, 54 yards, 1 TD (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Johnson is a touchdown-dependent TE whoâ€™s seen increased targets in New Orleansâ€™ offense. Heâ€™s a solid streaming option for teams needing TE help.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tank Bigsby (RB, JAX):</strong>
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong> 7 carries, 37 yards; 1 reception, 7 yards (Week 13).</p>
                <p>Bigsby is a valuable handcuff to Travis Etienne and could step into a larger role if injuries strike. Heâ€™s a speculative add for playoff-bound teams.</p>
